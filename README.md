Description: This project contains implementations of various sorting algorithms in Java.
It includes the following algorithms: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort,Insertion Sort,Merge Sort, Quick Sort,

Usage: Each of the sorting algorithms is implemented as a separate static method in the Main class. To use any of the algorithms, simply call the corresponding method, passing it an array that needs to be sorted as an argument.
